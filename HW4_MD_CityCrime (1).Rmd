In this assignment, we will be working with a dataset of total crimes reported by Maryland cities for two consecutive years. You'll load the data, calculate the violent and property crime rates for each city for both years, and then calculate the percentage change in the crime rates between the two years. You'll also write a short story based on your findings.

### Task 1: Load the Tidyverse and Janitor

You will need to load the tidyverse library and the janitor library

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
```

Then you'll load the data from the web. The URL for the data is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_cities_crime_2019_2020.csv. You will create a dataframe called `md_cities` that contains the data from this URL.

### Task 2: Load the Data

```{r}
md_cities<- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_cities_crime_2019_2020.csv") 

  md_cities |> 
  clean_names()
```
### Task 3: Calculating Rates

Calculate violent and property crime rates for each city for both years using `mutate()`. You'll create four new columns: `violent_rate_2019`, `property_rate_2019`, `violent_rate_2020`, and `property_rate_2020`. You'll need to figure out the proper unit rate, given that there are varying populations. There's no perfect choice; choose the one that works best for you. Save the results to a new dataframe called `md_cities_rates`.

```{r}
md_cities_rates <- md_cities |>  
  mutate(violent_rate_2019 = (violent2019/pop2019) * 10000) |>
  mutate(property_rate_2019 = (property2019/pop2019) * 10000) |>
  mutate(violent_rate_2020 = (violent2020/pop2020) * 10000) |>
  mutate(property_rate_2020 = (property2020/pop2020) * 10000)
```

### Task 4: Describe the Rates

Examine the new dataframe, `md_cities_rates`, by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio and sorting by the rate columns. Write a couple of sentences about the results, comparing and contrasting the cities with the highest rates (both violent and property) in 2019 and 2020. Do you see any patterns? What does this tell you about crime in Maryland cities? What's the story here?

I noticed how there are some places that face extreme crime, while some of them experience significantly less crime. I also saw how in some of the cities there were 0s in their data for violent and/or property crimes. I saw how the cities with more people have more crime due to the higher population. Like places such as Baltimore City have much of a higher population (588,593) than all the other cities so the crime numbers are significantly higher than a place like Eagle Harbor in Prince George's County because they only have a population of 65. I think this shows that crime in Maryland cities seems to depend on how many people live in the city and where that city is located.I think the story here could be investigating a place with a high population like Baltimore City and comparing the environment and crime to a place like Eagle Harbor that has a very small population.


### Task 5: Calculate Percentage Change

Let's add two percentage change columns to your dataframe: one for violent crime rates and one for property crime rates. You'll calculate the percentage change between 2019 and 2020 for each city. Save the results to a new dataframe called `md_cities_change`.

```{r}
md_cities_change <- md_cities |>
  mutate(violent_change = ((violent2020 - violent2019) / violent2019) * 100,
    property_change = ((property2020 - property2019) / property2019) * 100
  )
```

### Task 6: Describe Percentage Changes

Look at the `md_cities_change` dataframe by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio. Write a couple of sentences describing the percentage change results. What's more interesting here, the patterns or the outliers? What's the story in the data?

I noticed that there seem to be more of a negative change in the property crime numbers than the violent crime numbers.I also realized there are a lot more NaNs (Not a number) in the violent crime change than the property crime change. I think the outliers might be more interesting than the patterns because there are multiple not a numbers and infinity results in both property and violent crime numbers. I think that would be an interesting story in the data and finding out why those are the results.

### Task 7: Tell the Best Story

Write up a lede and nutgraf of a story with the _best_ story idea you've found in this assignment. The lede should be a single sentence that summarizes the most important information in the data. The nutgraf should be a paragraph that provides more context and explains why the data is important.

As the population grows in Baltimore City, so does the crime rates. 

With a population in 2020 of 588,593 in Baltimore City, that has lead the number of crimes to be significantly higher than all the other Maryland cities. In 2019, Baltimore City had 9,402 violent crimes in 2020 and 18,540 property crimes in 2020. Compared to Eagle Harbor in Prince George's County that has a population of 65, there was 0 property and violent crimes. The reasoning behind the higher crime rate is because Baltimore City has a significantly higher population and also be due to the location of Baltimore City. 

### Task 8: Save Your Work and Put it on GitHub

Save this notebook, then commit it to your local repository. Push the changes to your GitHub repository and submit the URL for this file in ELMS.
