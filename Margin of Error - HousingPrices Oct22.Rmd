Activity

Divide into groups, and one of you should have access to a calculator (Google's calculator is fine). Here's your scenario:

You've received these poll results and are assigned to write a story about them. For each scenario, decide if the headline 'Majority Supports New City Policy' is statistically justified.

Poll Scenarios:

52% support, sample size 100
53% support, sample size 800
55% support, sample size 400
For each of these scenarios, you'll calculate the margin of error - the plus/minus for that support percentage. The formula is:

MoE = 1/√n × 100

Where:

MoE is the margin of error (expressed as a percentage)
√n is the square root of the sample size
Calculate the margin of error.
**Submit the margin of error results here:**
1. MoE = 10 
2. MoE = 3.54
3. MoE = 5

Answer the following questions:

--  Is the headline 'Majority Supports New City Policy' statistically justified?
--  What alternative headline would be more accurate?

**Write your answers here:**
1. I think the headline 'Majority Supports New City Policy' is statistically justified. I think the headline is very broad and could be more specific since including the low-end of margin of error most of the percentages would then be less than 50% of support. I think it would have to be more specific with the data and follow the margin of error for a headline to be more statistically justified.

2. A more accurate headline would be 'Less than half of population support New City Policy.' Keeping in the mind the margin of error this will be statistically justified. 

Each person submits their own answers to the questions.

Local officials have claimed that a new light rail line has increased property values in a local neighborhood.

Before the transit line opened, homes in that neighborhood sold for an average of $285,000, with a standard deviation of $32,000.

Since the extension opened, your news team collected sales data from 14 recent home sales in the neighborhood:
$297,000, $305,000, $292,000, $318,000, $290,000, $311,000, $299,000, $325,000, $302,000, $288,000, $307,000, $315,000, $320,000, $294,000

As a journalist, you need to determine: **Is there statistical evidence that the transit line has actually increased home values?**

Follow along, running the code when directed. If you have questions, ask either in class or put them just below the section you have a question about.

## Task 1: Organize your data

```{r}
# Known information about home values before the transit line
prior_mean <- 285000  # average home value
prior_sd <- 32000     # standard deviation

# Home sale prices after the transit line opened (14 homes)
new_prices <- c(297000, 305000, 292000, 318000, 290000, 311000, 299000, 
                325000, 302000, 288000, 307000, 315000, 320000, 294000)

# Create a journalist-friendly dataset
home_data <- tibble(
  sale_id = 1:14,
  sale_price = new_prices
)

# View the data
home_data
```

## Task 2: Calculate key statistics

```{r}
# Calculate statistics on the new home price data
new_stats <- home_data |> 
  summarise(
    mean = mean(sale_price),
    sd = sd(sale_price),
    n = n(),
    min = min(sale_price),
    max = max(sale_price)
  )

new_stats
```

## Task 3: Make a chart

```{r}
# Function to format currency values
dollar_format <- function(x) {
  paste0("$", format(x/1000, big.mark=","), "K")
}

# Create a visualization of home prices with reference to previous average
ggplot(home_data, aes(x = reorder(sale_id, sale_price), y = sale_price)) +
  geom_col(fill = "seagreen", alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = prior_mean, color = "darkred", size = 1, linetype = "dashed") +
  annotate("text", x = 3, y = prior_mean - 8000, 
           label = "Previous Average ($285K)", hjust = 0, fontface = "bold", color = "darkred") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format) +
  labs(
    title = "Home Sales After Transit Line",
    subtitle = "Horizontal line shows previous neighborhood average of $285,000",
    x = "Recent Home Sales",
    y = "Sale Price",
    caption = "Source: County Property Records"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  )
```

## Task 4: Perform a hypothesis test

This is where we formally test the officials' claim that the transit line has increased home values.

**Hypotheses:**
- H₀: μ ≤ $285,000 (The transit line has not increased home values)
- H₁: μ > $285,000 (The transit line has increased home values)

```{r}
# Perform a one-sample t-test
# Since we want to know if home values increased, we use a one-sided test (alternative = "greater")
t_test_result <- t.test(
  home_data$sale_price,
  mu = prior_mean,
  alternative = "greater"
)

# Display the results
t_test_result
```

## Task 5: Interpreting the results for your story

Here's a formatting trick to better read the p value without the scientific notation. I find it easier to eyeball the results and compare with the 0.05 p value parameter
```{r}
p_value <- t_test_result$p.value

format(p_value, scientific = FALSE)

```



```{r}
# Extract the p-value
p_value <- t_test_result$p.value

# Calculate the 95% confidence interval
ci <- t.test(home_data$sale_price)$conf.int

# Format and display the confidence interval in a readable way
ci_formatted <- tibble(
  `Lower bound` = dollar_format(ci[1]),
  `Upper bound` = dollar_format(ci[2]),
  `Confidence level` = "95%"
)

# Display as a nice table
ci_formatted

# Set our significance level
alpha <- 0.05

# Compare and make a decision
if(p_value < alpha) {
  conclusion <- "The data provides statistical evidence supporting the claim that the transit line has increased home values."
} else {
  conclusion <- "The data does not provide strong statistical evidence that the transit line has increased home values."
}

# Create a tibble to display the key statistics for your story
story_stats <- tibble(
  `Previous average` = dollar_format(prior_mean),
  `New average` = dollar_format(mean(new_prices)),
  `Increase` = dollar_format(mean(new_prices) - prior_mean),
  `Percent change` = paste0(round(((mean(new_prices) - prior_mean) / prior_mean) * 100, 1), "%"),
  `p-value` = p_value,
  p_value_formatted = format(p_value, scientific = FALSE),
  `Statistically significant?` = if_else(p_value < alpha, "Yes", "No")
)

# Display the key statistics
story_stats

print(conclusion)

```

## Task 6: What's the story?

After disucssion the results, each person writes a couple of sentences for the top of a story about local officials' claims on the impact of the transit line and what the data says. Remember that there are lots of possible reasons that could influence the price of a home. Make your sentences newsy.

Recent statistical data from County Property Records shows that there is an increase in the value of home prices after transit line.The statistical test found that it was highly probable based on the result being higher than a base test value. The previous average of the price of housing was $285k and that average has gone up by about $19,500 since the transit line was built. Some of the reasons for the average increase of housing going up could be due to more access to different places and has brought more people to the area.
